# About this Repo
From 2015-16, the Product Team at [Think Through Math](https://www.thinkthroughmath.com) went through the process of documenting the team's core [values](values.md), as well as our expectations for staff at various points in the career ladder. We have open-sourced these values and expectations documents in the hope that they are valuable to others. Note that in some cases the documents reference expectations specific to our industry, education technology (specifically math).

Currently there are expectations documents for the following roles:
* [Software Engineer](software_engineer.md)
* [Senior Software Engineer](senior_software_engineer.md)
* [Engineering Manager](engineering_manager.md)
